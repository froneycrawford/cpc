From Route 30, take the Harrisburg Pike exit and head east on
Harrisburg Pike (this is a left turn from the off ramp if you are
coming from the east, and a right turn from the off ramp if you are
coming from the west).  Travel a little over a mile on Harrisburg Pike
until you see the Iron Hill Brewery at a traffic light.  At the
traffic light make a right turn into Williamson Parking Lot. The
LSP Building's front entrance 
directly abuts the parking lot and is on the right as you drive into the
parking lot from the street.
