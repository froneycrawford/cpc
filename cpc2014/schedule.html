<p>


We'd like there to be ample time for discussion after each
presentation.  The times listed after the talks indicate the talk time
+ discussion time (in units of minutes).  Speakers should make sure
that their talks are no longer than the <i>talk</i> time.

<p>

All oral presentations will be in Bonchek Auditorum in the LSP Building.

(Penn State University),
"A Good Hard Look at Growing Supermassive Black Holes in the
Distant Universe"

<p>

<i>
Sensitive cosmic X-ray surveys with the Chandra, XMM-Newton, and
NuSTAR observatories have revolutionized our ability to find and
study distant active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the main sites
of supermassive black hole growth in the Universe. I will describe
some of the resulting discoveries about the demography, physics,
and ecology of AGNs. Topics covered will include the utility of
deep X-ray plus multiwavelength surveys for investigating distant
AGNs; evolution constraints for the typical AGNs of the distant
Universe; the cosmic balance of power between supermassive black
holes and stars; interactions between AGNs and their hosting
galaxies; and the AGN content of newly forming galaxies. I will
end by discussing some key outstanding questions and new
observations and missions that aim to answer them.
