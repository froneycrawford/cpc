<p>

<b>By Car:</b> From Route 30, take the Harrisburg Pike exit and head
east on Harrisburg Pike (this is a left turn from the off ramp if you
are coming from the east, and a right turn from the off ramp if you
are coming from the west).  Travel a little over a mile on Harrisburg
Pike until you see a Wendy's and turf soccer field on your left, both
about 50 yards before a traffic light. Make a left at this traffic
light into the parking lot. In the lot bear right, and park. After
parking, keep walking along Harrisburg Pike in the same direction you
drove (east) about 50 yards to the next traffic light, which is right
at Iron Hill Brewery. Walk across Harrisburg Pike at this light and
enter the Williamson Lot.  At the far end of Williamson Lot is the
Kaufman building.
