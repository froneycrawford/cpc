<font size=+2>Important Conference Update</font>

Due to the spread of the COVID-19 virus, and restrictions on our
campus around travel and large gatherings, we have made the difficult
decision to cancel the 40th Annual Central Pennsylvania Consortium
Astronomers' Meeting at F&M scheduled for Saturday, April 4, 2020.

<p>

We are sorry that attendees will miss out on the opportunity to
present their research and/or hear about other research that is
happening in the CPC consortium, but health concerns must be a
priority in these uncertain times.  Questions can be directed to Lynn
Johnson at lynn.johnson&#064;fandm.edu or 717-291-4136.

<p>

We hope to see you at next year's CPC conference.
