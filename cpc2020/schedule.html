<i>
Over the past couple decades, thousands of extra-solar planets have
been discovered orbiting other stars. The exoplanets discovered to
date exhibit a wide variety of orbital and compositional properties;
most are dramatically different from the planets in our own Solar
System. The search for a true earth twin continues, but the diverse
sample of exoplanets discovered to date still have much to teach about
the history and habitability of planetary systems. I will present what
we've learned from observations and simulations about their formation
and evolution and discuss how we can best study future individual
potentially habitable planets in the context of their planetary
systems.
