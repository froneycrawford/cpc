<i>
Our home galaxy, the Milky Way, is a typical large disk galaxy and can
be used as a template for understanding how galaxies form. We can
obtain much more detailed information about the stars that make up our
Galaxy than we can for more distant galaxies. Stars retain memory of
the conditions in which they formed and stars of mass like the Sun
live for essentially the age of the Universe. We can thus use old
stars nearby to probe the early epochs of galaxy evolution, in a very
complementary way to direct observations of galaxies at high
redshift. I will discuss how observations of stars in the Milky Way
and in its satellite galaxies shed light on fundamental questions such
as the nature of the dark matter that dominates how galaxies form and
evolve.
