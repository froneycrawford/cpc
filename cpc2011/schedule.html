<p>


We'd like there to be ample time for discussion after each
presentation.  The times listed after the talks indicate the talk time
+ discussion time (in units of minutes).  Speakers should make sure
that their talks are no longer than the <i>talk</i> time.

<p>

All oral presentations will be in Stahr Auditorum in Stager Hall.

"Probing Fundamental Physics with Radio Pulsars"

<p>

<i>
Since their discovery over 40 years ago, radio pulsars (rapidly
rotating, highly magnetized neutron stars) continue to surprise and delight
astronomers and physicists. Their clock-like rotational stability permits
measurements of various neutron star and any orbiting companion star
parameters to extraordinary precision. In this talk, following a basic
review of pulsar astronomy, I explore some of the current applications of
pulsar timing measurements: (a) neutron star mass measurements; (b) tests of
general relativity; (c) pulsars as gravitational wave detectors. I will also
look ahead to some of the many upcoming facilities that are likely to
further improve our knowledge in these and other areas in the coming
decade.</i>
